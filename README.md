This project is a browser-based Tic Tac Toe game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

HTML defines the game layout and board structure.

CSS adds styling with responsive design, making the board clean and visually appealing.

JavaScript handles the game logic including player turns, win/draw detection, and reset functionality.
